1. [Eric W. Bailey - Organize Your CSS Declarations Alphabetically](https://ericwbailey.design/writing/organize-your-css-declarations-alphabetically/)
    - **TLDR** Organize your CSS properties (like `font-size`, `height`, `padding`, etc) alphabetically since right now there is no standard of organization. This will help us focus on other aspects of CSS.
2. [Hocus Focus](https://focus.hteumeuleu.com/)
    - **SUMMARY** An 8 level game that uses the `shift`, `shift + tab`, and `enter` key to get from start to finish. Beware of the ghost who will mess with focus ability. It's always good to be aware what is focusable within your website.
3. [Chris Ferdinandi - When should you use object-oriented programing (OOP)?](https://gomakethings.com/when-should-you-use-object-oriented-programing-oop/)
    - **TLDR** Whenever youâ€™re going to being creating more than one or two of an item in JavaScript that has some shared properties and some unique ones.
